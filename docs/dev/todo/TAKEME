UNASSIGNED TODOS
----------------
The following list of todos has not been assigned to any developer.
Feel free to pick one!

CORE
----
- remove var=foo calls on remote side. Use -o SendEnv (yeah, see ssh_config(5))

TESTS
-----
- multiple defines of object:
   - fail if different parameters
   - succeed if same parameters
- verify that all env variables in doc/man/cdist-reference.text.sh
    exist in the right stages
- test DependencyResolver


USER INTERFACE
--------------
- Cache
   - add example how to use 
   - export variable $__cache
      -> for current host
      -> add function to cdist-config, import from cdist-cache

- Define / document "this is what should be on host X"
   and have it parsable by different (shinken) tool
   -> given after manifest run already!

- use absent/present for state by default?
- buggy output with packages that don't exist in archlinux and fedora:
   python3 vs. python

TYPES
------
- Add testing framework (proposed by Evax Software)
- __user
   add option to include --create-home
- __cron: Support --file to be used instead of user cron (probably direct support
    of /etc/cron.d)

- Support uci from openwrt?
