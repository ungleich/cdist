NAME
    fusioninventory-agent - FusionInventory agent For Linux/UNIX, Windows
    and MacOSX

SYNOPSIS
    fusioninventory-agent [ ... ] [ *--server server* | *--local /tmp* ]...

EXAMPLES
        % fusioninventory-agent --server localhost
        # send an inventory to the OCS server

        % fusioninventory-agent --server http://localhost/ocsinventory2
        # send an inventory over http to a server with a non standard
        # virtual directory

        % fusioninventory-agent --server https://localhost/ocsinventory
        # send an inventory over https to the OCS server

        % fusioninventory-agent --local /tmp
        # write an inventory in the /tmp directory

        % fusioninventory-agent --local /tmp --html
        # Use the --html parameter to generate a HTML file

        % fusioninventory-agent --server localhost --user=toto --password=pw --realm="Restricted Area"
        # send a report to a server protected by a basic authentication
        % fusioninventory-agent --lazy
        # send an inventory only if a random delay between 0 and PROLOG_FREQ had been run over.

        % fusioninventory-agent --delaytime 60 -d
        # If NO PROLOG_FREQ has been preset, pick a time between execution and --delaytime for the agent to contact the server [default is 3600 seconds]

DESCRIPTION
    fusioninventory-agent is an agent for OCS Inventory server and
    FusionInventory for GLPI servers. It creates local inventory of the
    machines (hardware and software) and send it to the server. It can also
    write it in a local XML file. This agent is the successor of the former
    linux_agent which was released with OCS 1.01 and prior. It also replaces
    the Solaris/AIX/BSD unofficial agents.

    Supported systems:

    Windows (since Windows 2000)
    GNU/Linux
    MacOSX
    Solaris
    FreeBSD
    NetBSD
    OpenBSD
    AIX
    HP-UX
    GNU/kFreeBSD

  PROCEDURE
    Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

    You can also run the agent from the tarball directory. In this case, use
    the --devlib flag to load the library from the local directory.

  SYSTEM-SPECIFIC INFORMATIONS
   Solaris
    Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency. The generated
    Makefile needs gmake to be executed. The default installation will
    install the binary in /usr/perl5/5.XXXXX/bin, set you $PATH variable
    according to that.

    On Solaris/SPARC, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number
    with it. Download it from
    <http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a>

   Windows
    If you don't want to use the installer for Windows you can follow the
    installation process avalaible there:
    <http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent/wiki/Ru
    nAgentWin32>

  POST-INSTALLATION
    Run ./fusioninventory-agent-config for automatic configuration.

OCS INVENTORY PROTOCOL
    FusionInventory Agent uses OCS Inventory protocol and is compatible with
    OCS Inventory server. The agent uses the same protocol with the
    FusionInventory For GLPI plugin.

    The OCS protocol is basicly an exchange of XML file done over HTTP(S).

  First, The PROLOG
    The agent send a first message to give it's ID (DEVICEID). The server
    send back to the agent an XML file with a list of parameter. It's the
    PROLOG RESP. You can see it if you're in Debug mode. In this PROLOG, the
    server send the PROLOG_FREQ. The agent will use it to know when it need
    to contact the server for the next time.

    The agent compute the next query date this way:

         PROLOG_FREQ/2+RANDOM(PROLOG_FREQ/2)

  Module execution
    The agent will launch each modules and pass the list of options found in
    the PROLOG RESP as parameter. The module can send information directly
    to the server (inventory, SNMP scan result, etc)

  Windows service or Deamon mode
    In deamon mode, the agent wait during a period between the last PROLOG
    and PROLOG_FREQ. If PROLOG_FREQ is not set, it will use --delaytime
    value. The default value is 3600.

OPTIONS
    Most of the options are available in a *short* form and a *long* form.
    For example, the two lines below are all equivalent:

        % fusioninventory-agent -s localhost
        % fusioninventory-agent --server localhost

    --backend-collect-timeout=SECONDS_BEFORE_KILL
        Time before the agent kills modules processing which don't end
        before the timeout.

    --basevardir=*DIR*
        Indicate the place where the agent should store its files.

    --color
        Display color on the terminal. This feature is disabled on Windows.

    -d, --daemon
        Launch fusioninventory-agent as daemon in background. Proc::Daemon
        is needed.

    -D, --daemon-no-fork
        Launch fusioninventory-agent in daemon but do fork in background.

    --ca-cert-dir=*PATH*
        The directory where public SSL certificates are stored. In general
        it's /etc/ssl/certs.

        You don't need to copy a public certificate on very agent if your
        private key is valide and was been signed by a valide certificate
        authority.

    --ca-cert-file=*FILE*
        The path to the public certificate (e.g: /etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem).
        If --ca-cert-file is used, --ca-cert-dir is ignored.

        You don't need to copy a public certificate on very agent if your
        private key is valide and was been signed by a valide certificate
        authority.

    --conf-file=*FILE*
        Load the configuration file from the given location. Ignored on
        Windows.

        On Windows the settings are loaded from the registry. The
        information are stored there:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\FusionInventory-Agent

        Or on Windows 64bit machine:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\FusionInventory-Agent

    --debug
        Turn the debug mode on.

    --devlib
        This option is designed for the developer. With it enabled,
        fusioninventory-agent won't try to load the Backend module installed
        on the system. Instead it will scan the ./lib directory. It may also
        be useful if you don't want to install the agent on your system.

        This option can only be used as command line argument. It will be
        ignored if you set it in a config file or in Windows registry.

    --delaytime=SECONDS_TO_WAIT
        This option defaults to waiting a random() time between 0 and 3600
        before initially contacting the server assuming NO PROLOG_FREQ has
        been set. Once PROLOG_FREQ has been set, it uses that number at the
        top end of it's random setting. Useful for pre-setting a deployed
        agent's initial start time (so you don't jam the server all at once,
        but don't have to wait an hour to make sure the deployment worked).

    --disable-perllib-envvar
        Do not use PERL5LIB and PERLLIB environment variable to find Perl
        library path.

        This option can only be used as command line argument. It will be
        ignored if you set it in a config file or in Windows registry.

    -f, --force
        The agent ask first the server if it should send an inventoroy of
        the machine. If the server doesn't know the machine or has outdated
        informations, it will request it. With this option, the agent ignore
        the server anwser and send an inventory.

    --html
        Save the local inventory requested by --local in HTML.

    -i, --info
        Turn the verbose mode on. The flag is ignored if --debug is enable.

    --lazy
        Do not contact the server more than one time during the PROLOG_FREQ
        and do an exit if there is nothing to do. Useful if you want to
        start the agent script regulary from the crontab but don't want to
        overload the server.

    -l, --local=*DIR*
        Write an inventory in the *DIR* directory. A new file will be
        created if needed.

    --logfile=*FILE*
        Log message in *FILE* and turn off STDERR

    --logfile-maxsize=*FILE*
        Max logfile size in MB, default is unlimited. When the max size is
        reached, the file is truncated. This is only useful if there is no
        log rotation mechanism on the system.

    --logger=*LOGGER:*
        The logger you want to use. It can be:

        *   Stderr: print the messages directly in the console. Messages are
            lost in daemon mode (--daemon). You can use --color to turn
            color mode on.

        *   File: log the error in a log file. Please use --logfile to set
            the location of your log file. --logfile turns this option on
            automatically

        *   Syslog: use the local syslog server to log the messages.

        You can use more than one parameter if you use ',' as delimiter.
        E.g:

         % fusioinventory-agent --logger=Syslog,Stderr --local=/tmp

    --no-deploy
        Disable the software deployment (new module).

    --no-esx
        Disable the ESX inventory task.

    --no-ocsdeploy
        Disable the software deployment (OCS compatible module).

    --no-inventory
        Do not generate inventory.

    --no-wakeonlan
        Do not use the wakeonlan.

    --no-printer
        Do not inventory the printer.

    --no-software
        Do not inventory the software installed on the machine.

    --no-p2p
        For OCS Inventory software deployment. Do not use peer 2 peer to
        download files.

    -p, --password=*PASSWORD*
        Use *PASSWORD* for an HTTP authentification with the server.

    -P, --proxy=*PROXY*
        Use *PROXY* to specify a proxy HTTP server. By default, the agent
        uses HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

    -r, --realm=*REALM*
        Use *REALM* for an HTTP authentification with the server. For
        example, the value can be 'Restricted Area'. You can find it in the
        login popup of your Internet browser.

        if no realm is passed and the auth fails, the agent will retry an
        authentification with the realm returned by the server.

    --rpc-ip=*IP*
        The IP address of the interface to use for the P2P exchange. The
        default is 'all' the IP addresses with a 255.255.255.0 mask except
        127.0.0.1.

    --rpc-port=*PORT*
        The PORT of the interface to use for the embedded HTTP server used
        for the peer to peer data exchange and remote control. The default
        is '62354'.

    --rpc-trust-localhost
        Allow local users to access to http://127.0.0.1:62354/now to force
        an inventory immediately.

    --scan-homedirs
        Should the agent scan the user directories to inventory their
        virtual machines ?.

    -s, --server=*URI*
        The uri of the server. If *URI* doesn't start with http:// or
        https://, the agent assume the parameter is a hostname and rewrite
        it like that:

            % --server=http://servername/ocsinventory

        If you want to use https or another virtual directory (e.g:
        /ocsinventory2) you need to enter the full path.

        You can declare more than one server if you use the ',' delimiter.

            % --server=http://servername/ocsinventory,server2

        In general, OCS Inventory server URL have this format:

            http://servername/ocsinventory

        and FusionInventory for GLPI this one:

            http://servername/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/front/plugin_fusioninventory.communication.php

        --server is ignored if --local is in use.

    --share-dir
        The directory where are stored the shared files. You probably don't
        need this option unless you don't want to use the Makefile.PL
        installation procedure or if File::ShareDir is not avalaible.

    --stdout
        Print the inventory on stdout.

            % fusioninventory-agent --stdout > /tmp/report.xml
            # prepare an inventory and write it in the /tmp/report.xml file.
            # A file will be created.

    --scan-homedirs
        Authorize the agent to scan home directories to help with the
        Virtual Machines inventory.

    --tag=*TAG*
        Mark the machine with the *TAG* tag. Once the initial inventory is
        accepted by the server this value is ignored and you've to change
        the information directly on the server. The server do so in order to
        centralize the administration of the machine.

    --no-ssl-check
        Do now validate HTTPS certificat with the servers. Please never use
        this option in production. This is just a very bad idea.

        Hint: you can declare HTTPS_DEBUG to get SSL error messages in the
        console.

    -u *USER*, --user=*USER*
        Use *USER* for the server authentication.

    --version
        Print the version and exit.

    -w *DURATION*, --wait=*DURATION*
        Wait during a random period between 0 and DURATION second before
        initializing the connexion with the server.

            % fusioninventory-agent --wait 5 --server localhost

CONFIG FILE
    The agent try to initialize the settings from the agent.cfg config file.

    It looks for the file in these location:

    *   /etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg

    *   /usr/local/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg

    You can use the --conf-file=XXX parameter to load you own configuration
    file from a specific location. On Windows the settings are loaded from
    the Registry. The configuration file is ignored.

    The command line parameters overwrite the configuration file.

SECURITY
    Some modules like SNMPQuery needs to sent credential from the agent to
    the agent. We recommend to enable HTTPS support on the OCS or
    FusionInventory For GLPI server. We also recommend to use only trusted
    machine as agent in this case.
